# Building a Command Palette with ⌘K

Command palettes have become a staple of modern web applications. They provide quick access to features and navigation through keyboard shortcuts.

## What is a Command Palette?

A command palette is a search-driven interface that allows users to quickly:

- Navigate between pages
- Execute actions
- Search content
- Access features

Popular apps like VS Code, GitHub, and Linear use command palettes extensively.

## Key Features

### 1. Keyboard-First Design

The command palette is triggered with `⌘K` (Mac) or `Ctrl+K` (Windows/Linux). This makes it instantly accessible without reaching for the mouse.

### 2. Fuzzy Search

Users can type partial matches and the palette will filter results intelligently:

- "about" → "About Page"
- "cont" → "Contact Us"
- "dm" → "Demo"

### 3. Grouped Results

Results can be organized into categories:

- **Navigation**: Pages and routes
- **Actions**: Commands and features
- **Search**: Content results

## Implementation

Here's a basic structure for a command palette:

```typescript
interface Command {
  id: string;
  label: string;
  category: string;
  action: () => void;
}
```

### Using cmdk

We use the `cmdk` library which provides:

- Excellent keyboard navigation
- Fuzzy search
- Customizable styling
- Accessibility features

## Best Practices

1. **Keep it Fast**: Results should appear instantly
2. **Clear Labels**: Use descriptive, scannable labels
3. **Keyboard Hints**: Show keyboard shortcuts
4. **Recent Items**: Show recently accessed items
5. **Context Aware**: Show relevant commands based on current page

## Conclusion

A well-implemented command palette can significantly improve user productivity and satisfaction. It's a feature that power users will love and appreciate.
